-   Cumulative: each will build on the last
-   Answer keys (.xls and video) will be made available, and we will cover each as a group as well.
-   Designed in Excel, but structured in our (developing) "Pan-Decision-Analysis" (PAN-DA) framework.

## Worskthop Content

What does Pan-DA Mean?

::: incremental
- Our model structure template can be used for both Excel, and also extends into a (developing) R framework.
- This means you can parameterize & develop your model in Excel, but ultimately run the model in R. 
- Note that this is a developing framework---you are a very early "Alpha" tester!
