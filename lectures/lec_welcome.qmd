-   All course materials (slides, case studies, capstone exercises) are posted here.
-   Our (likely evolving) schedule will also be posted here, and updated regularly.

## Workshop Format

1.  We're *flexible* -- if there is a topic that is unclear to you, or that you would like expanded upon, please let us know!
2.  Mixed content

-   Lectures
-   Small group case studies
-   Large group case studies and "hands-on" Excel exercises
-   Capstone projects (small group or individual)

3.  Built from "ground up" for this workshop!

## Workshop Content

1.  Basics of decision analysis

-   Concepts and theories (Day 1)
-   Markov modeling (Day 2)
-   Summarizing and presenting results and sensitivity analysis (Days 3-4)
-   Advanced modeling techniques

## Workshop Content

2.  Case studies

-   Cumulative: each will build on the last
-   Answer keys (.xls and video) will be made available, and we will cover each as a group as well.
-   Designed in Excel, but structured in our (developing) "Pan-Decision-Analysis" (PAN-DA) framework.

## Workshop Content

What does Pan-DA Mean?

::: incremental
-   Our model structure template can be used for both Excel, and also extends into a (developing) R framework.
-   This means you can parameterize & develop your model in Excel, but ultimately run the model in R.
-   Note that this is a developing framework---you are a very early "Alpha" tester!

# Let's get started!

Assumptions:

Basic Markov Modeling knowledge

Outline

a\. Simple Model: Healthy, Sick, Dead "CVD"

a1. Competing rates versus simple conversion.

a2. Show a failing example from observed data (eigenvalue)

b\. Back convert CVD Model, Healthy, Sick, Acute Event (PCE), Dead "CVD"

c\. Adapt Background Mortality, Gompertz or other model

d.. New Markov model with new states, breaks out.

e\. New Evidence, Hazard Rate, PSA distribution

f\. Sample from Copulas
