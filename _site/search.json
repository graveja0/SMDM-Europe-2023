    "text": "This workshop will reinforce and expand advanced techniques not frequently taught in decision modeling courses. The course content centers around an applied exercise whereby a modeler seeks to back-convert an existing discrete-time Markov model, add additional health states and parameters (with uncertainty distributions), and adapt background mortality based on modeled life-table data from a different country, population, or setting. We will demonstrate how the augmented discrete time Markov model can be structured to accurately capture competing events and event dynamics that reflect the underlying continuous-time disease process. The course content will utilize the R programming language, though we will also provide Excel templates for some exercises.\nCourse Description and Objectives (max 300 words) (Provide a brief course description and state in bulleted format the objectives of the course.\nThis workshop will focus on important-but-infrequently-taught advanced skills and methods to facilitate the timely and efficient construction, execution, and adaptation of Markov models for health technology assessment and health policy decision-making. We will focus on discrete-time Markov models, though much of the course content applies to other modeling types as well. All course content will be taught in the R statistical programming language, though we will provide additional optional material for how the methods could be adapted to an Excel-based model.\nThe workshop will center around an applied exercise with the following objectives:\n\nBack-convert an existing discrete time Markov model to accommodate the inclusion of additional health states and literature-based parameters.\nAdapt background mortality based on modeled life-table data from a different country, population, or setting.\nInclusion of event accumulators in the embedded transition probability matrix to accurately capture competing events and event dynamics that reflect the underlying continuous-time process.\nMatch probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) uncertainty distribution parameters for the augmented model (e.g., parameters governing a normal, lognormal, beta, gamma, etc. distribution) to match values and quantiles ascertained through expert opinion surveys, prior research, etc.\n\nTo execute the above objectives, the workshop will provide didactic content, case-studies, and web-based (Shiny) tools for the following topics and methods:\nA. Back-converting a discrete-time Markov model into an underlying generator rate matrix using eigenvalue decomposition.\nB. Augmenting an underlying rate matrix with new parameters and health states.\nC. Including accumulators within an embedded transition probability matrix to accurately account for \"jumpover\" states that occur when a continuous time process is captured in a discrete-time model.\nD. Fitting and characterizing background mortality using a Gompertz model fit to life-table data.\nE. Algorithms to solve for uncertainty distribution parameters that match values and quantiles ascertained through expert opinions, prior research, etc.\nF. Capturing correlation among uncertain model parameters using PSA sampling via copulas.\nCourse Background: In 150 words or less, please provide a brief background on the skills taught in this course and how they are used.\nParticipants should have some experience designing and executing discrete-time Markov models. This workshop will build and extend upon these skills so that participants can efficiently adapt expand existing models to (a) include new health states and/or parameters (with associated uncertainty distributions); (b) convert the model to match population characteristics in alternative countries, settings, or contexts; (c) properly structure discrete-time models so that the transition probabilities and modeled outcomes accurately reflect an underlying continuous-time process.\nFormat and Requirements: In 150 words or less, describe the format of the class and include any prerequisites for participation, especially for intermediate and advanced level courses.\nParticipants should have some experience designing and executing discrete-time Markov models, including experience (a) converting rates to probabilities; (b) constructing a Markov trace from an underlying transition probability matrix; (c) structuring and executing a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). As the course content will be taught almost exclusively in R, prior experience with Markov models, microsimulation, or discrete event simulation in R is strongly encouraged.\nAM:\nStucturing the Markov model (from Bangkok and blend in content from blog posting)\nGroup Exercise (from Bangkok)\nIndivdiual/Small Group Case study (from appendix) — incorporate new evidence.\nPM:\n\nAdapting background mortality\nIndividual / Small Group Case Study (adapt background mortality)\nSolving for uncertainty distributions (put PSA distribution around new parameters in earlier case study)\nCorrelated PSA distributions via copula sampling"

What causes this difference?\n\n\nDiscretizing a Continuous Time Process\nThe answer boils down to the fact that with longer cycle lengths we “hide” some deaths that occur because a full healthy sick dead transition occurs within a single cycle.\nWhen we use the standard rate-to-probability conversion formula (i.e., \\(p_{HS}= 1 - e^{-r_{HS}\\Delta t}\\)) we obtain the marginal probability of transition. This marginal probability reflects the union of all possible transitions that start Healthy and then transition to and from the sick state in the cycle.\nThat is, \\(p_{HS}= 1 - e^{-r_{HS}\\Delta t}\\) captures the probability of following scenarios occurring in a cycle:\n\nIndividual transitions from healthy to sick.\nIndividual transitions from healthy to sick to dead.\n\nBy including case 2 in the healthy sick transition probability, we effectively rule out the possibility of becoming sick and dying within the same cycle. This implicit assumption means that we are no longer modeling a continuous time process, since we effectively “hide” some (quick) deaths that occur within a cycle due to the disease:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nHealthy\n\n Healthy   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Healthy\n\n    \n\nSick\n\n Sick   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nDead\n\n Dead   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nDead-&gt;Dead\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 9: compound Transition Patterns Using Standard Rate to Probability Conversion Formulas\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 9, and using standard rate-to-probability conversion formulas, the recorded states of a healthy sick dead transition are recorded in blue; the “hidden” transition is shown in red.\n\nAlternative Rate-to-Probability Conversion\nAnother set of formulas often used to account for competing risks are as follows:\n\\[\np_{HS}= \\frac{r_{HS}}{r_{HS}+r_{HD}}\\big ( 1 - e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\\big )\n\\]\n\\[\np_{HD}= \\frac{r_{HD}}{r_{HS}+r_{HD}}\\big ( 1 - e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\\big )\n\\]\n\\[\np_{HH} = e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\n\\]\nLet’s now use these formulas instead.\nFigure 10 shows the corresponding transition probability matrix:\n\n\nCode\nr_HD &lt;- 0.006\nr_SD &lt;- 10*0.006\n\nget_P(r_HS=r_HS,r_HD=r_HD,r_SD=r_SD,cycle=cycle) %&gt;% \nfilter(name==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \nselect(-name) %&gt;% \n#column_to_rownames(\"from\") %&gt;% \nmutate_at(vars(-from), ~round(.,4)) %&gt;% \ngt() %&gt;% \n  cols_label(\"from\"=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n0.8556\n0.1389\n0.0056\n\n\nSick\n0.0000\n0.9418\n0.0582\n\n\nDead\n0.0000\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Transition Probability Matrix Using Alternative Rate-to-Probability Conversion Formulas\n\n\n\nComparing Figure 6 and Figure 10, notice that a few things have changed. First, the probability of Healthy Sick transition declined. This would seem to be consistent with a world in which there are fewer alive sick individuals observed at the end of the cycle–which we would expect if acute illness results in a nontrivial number of quick deaths after illness onset in a cycle.\nHowever, look at the Healthy Dead transition probability change; it went down, too. If we were recording more acute deaths from the disease, we should see more Healthy Dead transitions from individuals sojourning through the Sick state on their way to death in a single cycle.\nWhat about state occupancy and life expectancy under different cycle lengths?\n\n\nCode\nres_60yst_cr &lt;- \n  check_sens(r_HD= r_HD, r_HS = r_HS, r_SD = r_SD, cycle=1) %&gt;% \n  filter(method==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle = \"1y\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle_t = 60)\n\nres_60yst_daily_cr &lt;- \n  check_sens(r_HD= r_HD, r_HS = r_HS, r_SD = r_SD,cycle=1/365) %&gt;% \n  filter(method==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle_t = cycle) %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle = \"Daily\")\n\nres_60yst_cr %&gt;% \n  bind_rows(res_60yst_daily_cr) %&gt;% \n  select(cycle,cycle_t,Healthy,Sick,Dead,life_exp) %&gt;% \n  gt::gt() %&gt;% \n  sub_missing(missing_text=\"-\") %&gt;% \n  fmt_number(columns = c(Healthy,Sick,Dead,life_exp),decimals=1) %&gt;% \n  cols_label(\"life_exp\" = \"Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncycle\ncycle_t\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\nLife Expectancy\n\n\n\n\n1y\n60\n0.1\n43.9\n956.0\n22.2\n\n\nDaily\n21900\n0.1\n42.6\n957.4\n21.7\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 1-Year vs. Daily Cycle\n\n\n\nCode\ndiff_st_cr &lt;- \n  res_60yst_cr %&gt;% \n    bind_rows(res_60yst_daily_cr) %&gt;% mutate(life_exp = life_exp-lead(life_exp)) %&gt;% pull(life_exp) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% as.vector()\n\n\nAgain, we have a difference in life expectancy of 0.462 years. So switching to the alternative formulas has not fundamentally solved our problem.\n\n\nHow do transition probabilities change as the Likelihood of Disease-related death varies?\nAnother way to see the issue is to plot how the transition probabilities change (or not) at different levels of disease acuity. Figure 12 plots the relevant transition probabilities under a yearly time cycle, and while allowing the underlying hazard rate of death from the disease (hr_S) to vary.\nAs the hazard rate increases, the likelihood of ending up dead within a given cycle increases. Indeed, in the most extreme case, imagine the disease has a near instantaneous death rate. In that case we should see almost no Healthy Sick transitions within a yearly cycle, because nearly everyone who became sick within the cycle died within 1 day.\nWe see in Figure 12 that the Healthy Sick probabilities remain flat for transitions under which background mortality is a competing event. However, the Sick Dead transition probabilities rise as the likelihood of fatal disease increases.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n    filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Yearly Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks.)\n\n\n\n\nIt is common practice to address these issues using the following guidelines:\n\nSelect a cycle length where the probability of remaining in a given state is at least 95%.\nPick a cycle length that aligns with the clinical/disease timelines of the decision problem.\n\nTreatment schedules.\nAcute vs. chronic condition.\n\n\nBut do these actually solve the issue? No. Figure 13 shows how the transition probabilities change when we switch to a daily cycle length. Again, we see the problem: as disease acuity increases, the probability of a Healthy Dead transition does not change; even though we shortened the cycle length, we have not fundamentally addressed the issue.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1/365) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n  filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n    scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Daily Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks.)\n\n\n\n\nHow does this all translate into model outputs, such as life expectancy? Figure 14 plots life-expectancy (y-axis) against the underlying disease hazard rate for death. Each line provides the life-expectancy curve under a different cycle length, with everything else in the model held fixed.\nNot surprisingly, we see that as the likelihood of fatal disease increases, life expectancy declines.\nBut the most important takeaway is that the modeled life expectancy differs depending on the cycle length used. For a given hazard rate the underlying disease process is exactly the same – but we get different answers depending on our cycle length.\nThe pattern of results is instructive, too. Essentially, with longer cycle lengths and incorrect transition probabilities, we will “miss” more compound within-cycle Healthy Sick Dead transitions and instead record them as Healthy Sick transitions. This has a net effect of “hiding” more disease-related death in our model – and life-expectancy is inflated as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Life Expectancy by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate and Cycle Length. The left panel uses the formula that accounts for competing risks. The right panel uses standard conversion formula."

Figure 15 shows how the transition probabilities vary by hazard rate.\nWe can now see we’ve achieved what we need: Healthy Dead transition probabilities that rise as the hazard rate of death from disease increases. Again, this occurs because as the likelihood of death after becoming ill increases, we increase the likelihood of a compound Healthy Sick Dead transition within a cycle. We need these to be recorded (accurately) as Healthy Dead transitions, rather than Healthy Sick transitions. Correspondingly, as the probability of a compound transition increases with an increasing hazard rate, the probability of a single Healthy Sick transition declines; we see this in Figure 15 as well.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n  #filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17,3)) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"darkgreen\",\"red\")) +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: 1-Year Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks, and P_eQ is embedded using the transition rate matrix Q.)\n\n\n\n\nWe also see that regardless of the cycle length used, we always end up with the same calculated life expectancy:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Life Expectancy by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate and Cycle Length\n\n\n\n\nWe have thus “fixed” our problem of hidden disease-related deaths!\n\nWhy is this important?\nThe use of an embedded transition probability matrix is important for a number of reasons:\n\nThe Markov model accurately reflects the underlying continuous time process.\nWe get an accurate accounting of disease-related deaths.\nWe can use whatever cycle length we need – this facilitates computationally intensive processes such as probabilistic sensitivity analyses, which may not be feasible with a short (e.g., daily) cycle length.\nWe also avoid “state explosion” in the event our model has tunnel states. For example, if there is a one-year tunnel state for costs or utilities following disease onset, if we switched to a monthly or daily cycle we’d have to build in dozens or more health states into our Markov model. Beacuse we can stick with a one-year cycle, this makes use of tunnel states much more feasible.\n\nThe primary “cost” of using this approach over standard rate-to-probability conversion formulas is that we must be a bit more careful in structuring our transition probability matrix to include accumulators used to aggregate model outputs. We will cover this process in the section directly below."

    "text": "2. Include Non-Markovian Accumulators to Record Event Transitions\nWe now have the correct transition probabilities to model the underlying continuous-time process, but how do we account for these compound transitions in our aggregation of model outputs?\nFundamentally, what we have now is a model that will correctly records the “true” number of deaths at the end of the cycle, because all the compound Healthy Sick Dead transitions are included in the Healthy Dead transition probability.\nTo track the total number of transitions to Sick, we must augment our transition probability matrix with non-Markovian accumulators.

To do this we simply add the appropriate transition rate (\\(r_{HS}\\)) in as an accumulator column:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\naccHS\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n-(\\(r_{HS}\\) + \\(r_{HD}\\))\n\\(r_{HS}\\)\n\\(r_{HD}\\)\n\\(r_{HS}\\)\n\n\nSick\n0\n-(\\(hr_{S} \\cdot r_{HD}\\))\n\\(hr_{S} \\cdot r_{HD}\\)\n0\n\n\nDead\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\naccHS\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nAn extra row of 0’s was added so that we balance the matrix, and ensure that we do not lose (or create!) anyone who becomes Sick.\nWe did not update the diagonal elements (i.e., the negative sum of transition rates); these stay the same as before.\nIf we wanted to add additional accumulators, we can just expand the matrix with more columns and rows as needed.\n\nHere is the augmented transition rate matrix for our example:\n\n\nCode\nQ_ &lt;- data.frame(Q)\nQ_[\"Healthy\",\"accHS\"] &lt;- params$r_HS\nQ_[\"accHS\",\"accHS\"] &lt;- 0\nQ_[is.na(Q_)] &lt;- 0\nQ_ &lt;- as.matrix(Q_)\nQ_ \n\n\n        Healthy  Sick  Dead accHS\nHealthy  -0.156  0.15 0.006  0.15\nSick      0.000 -0.06 0.060  0.00\nDead      0.000  0.00 0.000  0.00\naccHS     0.000  0.00 0.000  0.00\n\n\nWe next embed the transition probability matrix, as before:Notice that the accumulator (accHS) value is identical to the Healthy Sick transition probability we obtained using the alternative rate-to-probability conversion formula that accounted for competing risks (e.g., see Figure 10).\n\nP_ &lt;- expm(Q_)\nP_\n\n          Healthy      Sick        Dead     accHS\nHealthy 0.8555592 0.1346958 0.009744961 0.1388854\nSick    0.0000000 0.9417645 0.058235466 0.0000000\nDead    0.0000000 0.0000000 1.000000000 0.0000000\naccHS   0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000000 1.0000000\n\n\nUsing the accumulator we can accurately count up how many individuals transition to the Sick state over our time horizon:\n\nm_trace &lt;- \n  0:(horizon/cycle) %&gt;% \n  map_df(~(c(1000,0,0,0) %*% (P_%^%.x) %&gt;% data.frame()))\n\n\n\nCode\nm_trace[3,] %&gt;% \n  round(.,2) %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(var=\"cycle\") %&gt;% \n  select(-cycle) %&gt;% \n  kable() %&gt;% \n  kableExtra::kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n\n\nSick\n\n\nDead\n\n\naccHS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n731.98\n\n\n242.09\n\n\n25.93\n\n\n257.71\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: State Occupancy after Two Years\n\n\n\nWe see in Figure 17 that after 2 years, 257.7 people (out of 1,000) have become sick, which is slightly less than the 259 who became sick after 2 years in our world without death as a competing risk. Moreover, we see that state occupancy in the Sick category is lower, at 242.1. This lower value reflects the fact some people had a compound transition through Sick and ended up dead in the same cycle. The difference (15.6) amounts to the total number of individual deaths we “hid” in the model when we used the incorrect rate-to-probability conversion formulas.This, of course, makes sense, since there are a small number of people who die before they could become ill once we add background mortality to the model"

What causes this difference?\n\n\nDiscretizing a Continuous Time Process\nThe answer boils down to the fact that with longer cycle lengths we “hide” some deaths that occur because a full healthy sick dead transition occurs within a single cycle.\nWhen we use the standard rate-to-probability conversion formula (i.e., \\(p_{HS}= 1 - e^{-r_{HS}\\Delta t}\\)) we obtain the marginal probability of transition. This marginal probability reflects the union of all possible transitions that start Healthy and then transition to and from the sick state in the cycle.\nThat is, \\(p_{HS}= 1 - e^{-r_{HS}\\Delta t}\\) captures the probability of following scenarios occurring in a cycle:\n\nIndividual transitions from healthy to sick.\nIndividual transitions from healthy to sick to dead.\n\nBy including case 2 in the healthy sick transition probability, we effectively rule out the possibility of becoming sick and dying within the same cycle. This implicit assumption means that we are no longer modeling a continuous time process, since we effectively “hide” some (quick) deaths that occur within a cycle due to the disease:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nHealthy\n\n Healthy   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Healthy\n\n    \n\nSick\n\n Sick   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nDead\n\n Dead   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nDead-&gt;Dead\n\n   \n\n\nFigure 9: compound Transition Patterns Using Standard Rate to Probability Conversion Formulas\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 9, and using standard rate-to-probability conversion formulas, the recorded states of a healthy sick dead transition are recorded in blue; the “hidden” transition is shown in red.\n\nAlternative Rate-to-Probability Conversion\nAnother set of formulas often used to account for competing risks are as follows:\n\\[\np_{HS}= \\frac{r_{HS}}{r_{HS}+r_{HD}}\\big ( 1 - e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\\big )\n\\]\n\\[\np_{HD}= \\frac{r_{HD}}{r_{HS}+r_{HD}}\\big ( 1 - e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\\big )\n\\]\n\\[\np_{HH} = e^{-(r_{HS}+r_{HD})\\Delta t}\n\\]\nLet’s now use these formulas instead.\nFigure 10 shows the corresponding transition probability matrix:\n\n\nCode\nr_HD &lt;- 0.006\nr_SD &lt;- 10*0.006\n\nget_P(r_HS=r_HS,r_HD=r_HD,r_SD=r_SD,cycle=cycle) %&gt;% \nfilter(name==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \nselect(-name) %&gt;% \n#column_to_rownames(\"from\") %&gt;% \nmutate_at(vars(-from), ~round(.,4)) %&gt;% \ngt() %&gt;% \n  cols_label(\"from\"=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n0.8556\n0.1389\n0.0056\n\n\nSick\n0.0000\n0.9418\n0.0582\n\n\nDead\n0.0000\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Transition Probability Matrix Using Alternative Rate-to-Probability Conversion Formulas\n\n\n\nComparing Figure 6 and Figure 10, notice that a few things have changed. First, the probability of Healthy Sick transition declined. This would seem to be consistent with a world in which there are fewer alive sick individuals observed at the end of the cycle–which we would expect if acute illness results in a nontrivial number of quick deaths after illness onset in a cycle.\nHowever, look at the Healthy Dead transition probability change; it went down, too. If we were recording more acute deaths from the disease, we should see more Healthy Dead transitions from individuals sojourning through the Sick state on their way to death in a single cycle.\nWhat about state occupancy and life expectancy under different cycle lengths?\n\n\nCode\nres_60yst_cr &lt;- \n  check_sens(r_HD= r_HD, r_HS = r_HS, r_SD = r_SD, cycle=1) %&gt;% \n  filter(method==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle = \"1y\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle_t = 60)\n\nres_60yst_daily_cr &lt;- \n  check_sens(r_HD= r_HD, r_HS = r_HS, r_SD = r_SD,cycle=1/365) %&gt;% \n  filter(method==\"P_cr\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle_t = cycle) %&gt;% \n  mutate(cycle = \"Daily\")\n\nres_60yst_cr %&gt;% \n  bind_rows(res_60yst_daily_cr) %&gt;% \n  select(cycle,cycle_t,Healthy,Sick,Dead,life_exp) %&gt;% \n  gt::gt() %&gt;% \n  sub_missing(missing_text=\"-\") %&gt;% \n  fmt_number(columns = c(Healthy,Sick,Dead,life_exp),decimals=1) %&gt;% \n  cols_label(\"life_exp\" = \"Life Expectancy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncycle\ncycle_t\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\nLife Expectancy\n\n\n\n\n1y\n60\n0.1\n43.9\n956.0\n22.2\n\n\nDaily\n21900\n0.1\n42.6\n957.4\n21.7\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 1-Year vs. Daily Cycle\n\n\n\nCode\ndiff_st_cr &lt;- \n  res_60yst_cr %&gt;% \n    bind_rows(res_60yst_daily_cr) %&gt;% mutate(life_exp = life_exp-lead(life_exp)) %&gt;% pull(life_exp) %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% as.vector()\n\n\nAgain, we have a difference in life expectancy of 0.462 years. So switching to the alternative formulas has not fundamentally solved our problem.\n\n\nHow do transition probabilities change as the Likelihood of Disease-related death varies?\nAnother way to see the issue is to plot how the transition probabilities change (or not) at different levels of disease acuity. Figure 12 plots the relevant transition probabilities under a yearly time cycle, and while allowing the underlying hazard rate of death from the disease (hr_S) to vary.\nAs the hazard rate increases, the likelihood of ending up dead within a given cycle increases. Indeed, in the most extreme case, imagine the disease has a near instantaneous death rate. In that case we should see almost no Healthy Sick transitions within a yearly cycle, because nearly everyone who became sick within the cycle died within 1 day.\nWe see in Figure 12 that the Healthy Sick probabilities remain flat for transitions under which background mortality is a competing event. However, the Sick Dead transition probabilities rise as the likelihood of fatal disease increases.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n    filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Yearly Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks.)\n\n\n\n\nIt is common practice to address these issues using the following guidelines:\n\nSelect a cycle length where the probability of remaining in a given state is at least 95%.\nPick a cycle length that aligns with the clinical/disease timelines of the decision problem.\n\nTreatment schedules.\nAcute vs. chronic condition.\n\n\nBut do these actually solve the issue? No. Figure 13 shows how the transition probabilities change when we switch to a daily cycle length. Again, we see the problem: as disease acuity increases, the probability of a Healthy Dead transition does not change; even though we shortened the cycle length, we have not fundamentally addressed the issue.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1/365) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n  filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n    scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Daily Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks.)\n\n\n\n\nHow does this all translate into model outputs, such as life expectancy? Figure 14 plots life-expectancy (y-axis) against the underlying disease hazard rate for death. Each line provides the life-expectancy curve under a different cycle length, with everything else in the model held fixed.\nNot surprisingly, we see that as the likelihood of fatal disease increases, life expectancy declines.\nBut the most important takeaway is that the modeled life expectancy differs depending on the cycle length used. For a given hazard rate the underlying disease process is exactly the same – but we get different answers depending on our cycle length.\nThe pattern of results is instructive, too. Essentially, with longer cycle lengths and incorrect transition probabilities, we will “miss” more compound within-cycle Healthy Sick Dead transitions and instead record them as Healthy Sick transitions. This has a net effect of “hiding” more disease-related death in our model – and life-expectancy is inflated as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Life Expectancy by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate and Cycle Length. The left panel uses the formula that accounts for competing risks. The right panel uses standard conversion formula."

Figure 15 shows how the transition probabilities vary by hazard rate.\nWe can now see we’ve achieved what we need: Healthy Dead transition probabilities that rise as the hazard rate of death from disease increases. Again, this occurs because as the likelihood of death after becoming ill increases, we increase the likelihood of a compound Healthy Sick Dead transition within a cycle. We need these to be recorded (accurately) as Healthy Dead transitions, rather than Healthy Sick transitions. Correspondingly, as the probability of a compound transition increases with an increasing hazard rate, the probability of a single Healthy Sick transition declines; we see this in Figure 15 as well.\n\n\nCode\n1:10 %&gt;% map(~get_P(r_HS=.15,r_HD=.006,r_SD=.006*.x,cycle=1) %&gt;% mutate(hr_S=.x)) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows() %&gt;% \n  gather(transition,value,-from,-name,-hr_S) %&gt;% \n  spread(name,value) %&gt;% \n  filter(P_cr!=1 & P_cr!=0) %&gt;% \n  gather(method,value,-from,-hr_S,-transition) %&gt;% \n  #filter(method!=\"P_eQ\") %&gt;% \n  tibble() %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(transition), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate_at(vars(from), function(x) factor(x,levels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"),\n                                           labels=c(\"Healthy\",\"Sick\",\"Dead\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(from!=transition) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = hr_S, y = value)) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour=method, shape=method),size=3) + \n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19,17,3)) +\n  facet_wrap(from~transition, scales=\"free\") + \n  ggthemes::theme_base() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=.5))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values= c(\"blue\",\"darkgreen\",\"red\")) +\n  directlabels::geom_dl(aes(label = glue::glue(\"  {method}\")), method=\"last.bumpup\",hjust=1) + \n  labs(x = \"hr_S (Hazard Ratio for Sick-to-Dead)\",y = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: 1-Year Cycle - Transition Probabilities by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate (P_st uses standard conversion formula; P_cr uses the formula that accounts for competing risks, and P_eQ is embedded using the transition rate matrix Q.)\n\n\n\n\nWe also see that regardless of the cycle length used, we always end up with the same calculated life expectancy:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Life Expectancy by Sick-to-Dead Hazard Rate and Cycle Length\n\n\n\n\nWe have thus “fixed” our problem of hidden disease-related deaths!\n\nWhy is this important?\nThe use of an embedded transition probability matrix is important for a number of reasons:\n\nThe Markov model accurately reflects the underlying continuous time process.\nWe get an accurate accounting of disease-related deaths.\nWe can use whatever cycle length we need – this facilitates computationally intensive processes such as probabilistic sensitivity analyses, which may not be feasible with a short (e.g., daily) cycle length.\nWe also avoid “state explosion” in the event our model has tunnel states. For example, if there is a one-year tunnel state for costs or utilities following disease onset, if we switched to a monthly or daily cycle we’d have to build in dozens or more health states into our Markov model. Beacuse we can stick with a one-year cycle, this makes use of tunnel states much more feasible.\n\nThe primary “cost” of using this approach over standard rate-to-probability conversion formulas is that we must be a bit more careful in structuring our transition probability matrix to include accumulators used to aggregate model outputs. We will cover this process in the section directly below."

    "text": "2. Include Non-Markovian Accumulators to Record Event Transitions\nWe now have the correct transition probabilities to model the underlying continuous-time process, but how do we account for these compound transitions in our aggregation of model outputs?\nFundamentally, what we have now is a model that will correctly records the “true” number of deaths at the end of the cycle, because all the compound Healthy Sick Dead transitions are included in the Healthy Dead transition probability.\nTo track the total number of transitions to Sick, we must augment our transition probability matrix with non-Markovian accumulators. This accumulator shows up as a purple edge in our model diagram below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nHealthy\n\n Healthy   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Healthy\n\n    \n\nSick\n\n Sick   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nDead\n\n Dead   \n\nHealthy-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Sick\n\n    \n\nSick-&gt;Dead\n\n    \n\nDead-&gt;Dead\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, accumulators are easy to build in. We simply add the relevant transition rate in a new column in the transition rate matrix Q, while leaving everything else the same.\nSuppose we want to count up all the Healthy Sick transitions in the model. To do this we simply add the appropriate transition rate (\\(r_{HS}\\)) in as an accumulator column:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\nSick\nDead\naccHS\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n-(\\(r_{HS}\\) + \\(r_{HD}\\))\n\\(r_{HS}\\)\n\\(r_{HD}\\)\n\\(r_{HS}\\)\n\n\nSick\n0\n-(\\(hr_{S} \\cdot r_{HD}\\))\n\\(hr_{S} \\cdot r_{HD}\\)\n0\n\n\nDead\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\naccHS\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nNote the following:\n\nAn extra row of 0’s was added so that we balance the matrix, and ensure that we do not lose (or create!) anyone who becomes Sick.\nWe did not update the diagonal elements (i.e., the negative sum of transition rates); these stay the same as before.\nIf we wanted to add additional accumulators, we can just expand the matrix with more columns and rows as needed.\n\nHere is the augmented transition rate matrix for our example:\n\n\nCode\nQ_ &lt;- data.frame(Q)\nQ_[\"Healthy\",\"accHS\"] &lt;- params$r_HS\nQ_[\"accHS\",\"accHS\"] &lt;- 0\nQ_[is.na(Q_)] &lt;- 0\nQ_ &lt;- as.matrix(Q_)\nQ_ \n\n\n        Healthy  Sick  Dead accHS\nHealthy  -0.156  0.15 0.006  0.15\nSick      0.000 -0.06 0.060  0.00\nDead      0.000  0.00 0.000  0.00\naccHS     0.000  0.00 0.000  0.00\n\n\nWe next embed the transition probability matrix, as before:Notice that the accumulator (accHS) value is identical to the Healthy Sick transition probability we obtained using the alternative rate-to-probability conversion formula that accounted for competing risks (e.g., see Figure 10).\n\nP_ &lt;- expm(Q_)\nP_\n\n          Healthy      Sick        Dead     accHS\nHealthy 0.8555592 0.1346958 0.009744961 0.1388854\nSick    0.0000000 0.9417645 0.058235466 0.0000000\nDead    0.0000000 0.0000000 1.000000000 0.0000000\naccHS   0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000000 1.0000000\n\n\nUsing the accumulator we can accurately count up how many individuals transition to the Sick state over our time horizon:\n\nm_trace &lt;- \n  0:(horizon/cycle) %&gt;% \n  map_df(~(c(1000,0,0,0) %*% (P_%^%.x) %&gt;% data.frame()))\n\n\n\nCode\nm_trace[3,] %&gt;% \n  round(.,2) %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(var=\"cycle\") %&gt;% \n  select(-cycle) %&gt;% \n  kable() %&gt;% \n  kableExtra::kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy\n\n\nSick\n\n\nDead\n\n\naccHS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n731.98\n\n\n242.09\n\n\n25.93\n\n\n257.71\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: State Occupancy after Two Years\n\n\n\nWe see in Figure 17 that after 2 years, 257.7 people (out of 1,000) have become sick, which is slightly less than the 259 who became sick after 2 years in our world without death as a competing risk. Moreover, we see that state occupancy in the Sick category is lower, at 242.1. This lower value reflects the fact some people had a compound transition through Sick and ended up dead in the same cycle. The difference (15.6) amounts to the total number of individual deaths we “hid” in the model when we used the incorrect rate-to-probability conversion formulas.This, of course, makes sense, since there are a small number of people who die before they could become ill once we add background mortality to the model"

    "text": "This section provides advice on best practices for embedding literature-based parameters into discrete-time Markov models so that the final transition probabilities accurately represent the underlying continuous time process.\n\n\nIt is common to draw upon literature-based parameters when constructing a Markov model. A key first step is to assess the parameters of interest in a published study. For a given paper with published rates, thsi means determining whether they report a percentrage affected in a given time step, or continuous rates. While the units of both of these are essentially equivalent (by a factor of 100), the interpretation is different. It is a subtle but important difference.\nFor example, let’s assume that a stochastic event occurs to a group of individuals with a rate of 1/unit time. This follows an exponential distribution. We first create a sample of 20000 individuals.\n\nx &lt;- rexp(20000)\n\nhist(x)\n\n\n\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 1.011341\n\nmedian(x)\n\n[1] 0.7090352\n\n# Percentage in first time cycle\nsum(x &lt; 1) / length(x)\n\n[1] 0.62495\n\n\nThe mean is close to 1, but the percentage observed in the first time cycle is close to the theoretical 63.2%. This appears counter-intuitive but the long tail of the exponential distribution creates a situation where the continuous rate is not the observed percentage in a time cycle.\nThis leads to the widely-used rate-to-probability conversion formula:\n\\[p = 1 - e^{-r}\\] \\[r = -log(1-p)\\] where \\(p\\) represents the probability in a unit of time and \\(r\\) represents the continuous rate.\nWhen constructing a Markov model, it is best to start with the continuous rate when aggregating from many sources and embed this continuous rate into a timestep—thus creating probability transitions for each time step.\nTo find the probability transition matrix of a timestep in Markov modeling from the continuous the following formula is used:\n\\[ T_{prob} = e^{R} \\]\nWhere \\(R\\) is the continuous rate matrix, and each diagonal is the negative sum of the rest of the row elements. \\(T_{prob}\\) is the transition probability for a single time step, where each diagonal is 1 - the sum of the other row elements.\nOne could have rates that change at each time step and this would return the proper embedding of the rates allowing for them to compete.\n\n\n\nWhat if a given source of data provides observed transition probabilities and these are exclusionary states, i.e., competing? How could one reverse these probabilities and embed other competing events into the model?\nTo do this, one must solve for the generator matrix of the transition probability matrix using eigenvalue decomposition. Note that this is not always possible, as it is trivial to construct a transition probability matrix that has no generator.\nConsider the following, which builds on the example provided in the main text. We wish to approximate a continuous time process using a discrete-time Markov model with three distinct states: A (healthy), B (sick/intervention), and C (complication from intervention). Moreover, in continuous time, this process proceeds sequentially, i.e., A-&gt;B-&gt;C.\nA (naively) specified model has transitions from A-&gt;B and from B-&gt;C specified as probabilities within the selected time step. As noted in the main text, this model cannot truly approximate continuous time process, as within a given time step there is a non-zero probability of transitioning from healthy to complication (i.e., A-&gt;C, with an implied sojourn through B). That is, during a timestep it is possible to transition from A-&gt;C.\nBy incorrectly specifying all transitions, it makes it impossible to find a proper generator—though eigenvalue decomposition can be used to get as close as possible. If negative rates of transition are found using eigenvalue decomposition, then probabilities inconsistent with continuous rates have been specified.\nIn mathematical terms, the generator matrix is the matrix logarithm of the transition probability matrix. A matrix has a logarithm if and only if if it is invertible.\n\\[ A = \\log T_{prob} \\]\nThe \\(\\log\\) can be found using spectral or eigenvalue decomposition. If \\(V\\) is a matrix where equal column is an eigenvector of \\(T_{prob}\\), then,\n\\[A' = V^{-1} A V\\] \\[\\log T_{prob} = V (\\log A') V^{-1}\\]\n\n\nAs an example, we’ll consider a model from “Decision Modelling for Heath Economic Evaluation” by Briggs, Clatxon, and Sculpher. In Table 2.2, they define a transition probability matrix for HIV monotherapy that was derived from observed percent transitions in a patient cohort.\n\nhiv_monotherapy_tp &lt;- matrix(c(0.721, 0.202, 0.067, 0.010,\n                               0.000, 0.581, 0.407, 0.012,\n                               0.000, 0.000, 0.750, 0.250,\n                               0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000), \n                               nrow=4, byrow=TRUE,\n                               dimnames=list(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n                                             c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")))\nhiv_monotherapy_tp                                          \n\n      A     B     C     D\nA 0.721 0.202 0.067 0.010\nB 0.000 0.581 0.407 0.012\nC 0.000 0.000 0.750 0.250\nD 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nThe bottom diagonal was corrected to be a Markov absorbing state by having 1 on the diagonal. For the purposes of example, we’ll assume we wish to add an additional state “E”, which has a continuous rate of 0.2 that competes with other transitions.\nTo accomplish this we must find the continuous generator.\n\nV  &lt;- eigen(hiv_monotherapy_tp)$vectors\niV &lt;- solve(V)\nAp &lt;- iV %*% hiv_monotherapy_tp %*% V\n\nAp\n\n              [,1]          [,2]          [,3]          [,4]\n[1,]  1.000000e+00 -1.138759e-17  0.000000e+00  1.625347e-17\n[2,]  1.724225e-16  7.500000e-01  0.000000e+00 -1.565421e-16\n[3,] -1.054209e-15 -1.977467e-16  7.210000e-01  3.654408e-17\n[4,] -6.257371e-17 -1.879313e-17 -5.963692e-18  5.810000e-01\n\n\nDue to the numeric probabilities not being exactly correct, the off-diagonal elements of \\(A'\\) are not zero, but they are quite close. We will zero these off diagonal elements and assume that the non-zero elements are numerical error. Then continue by taking the log of the diagonal.\n\nlAp &lt;- diag(log(diag(Ap)), nrow(Ap), ncol(Ap))\n\nR  &lt;- V %*% lAp %*% iV\n\nR \n\n              [,1]          [,2]         [,3]        [,4]\n[1,] -3.271161e-01  3.114961e-01  0.002439536  0.01318051\n[2,]  2.558460e-18 -5.430045e-01  0.614888976 -0.07188445\n[3,]  0.000000e+00  7.064112e-18 -0.287682072  0.28768207\n[4,]  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00  0.000000000  0.00000000\n\n\nAn now we have the continuous time rate generator for the Markov Model. There is still some numerical error—for example the bottom row, has values very near to zero, and the diagonal is not exactly the negative sum of the rest of the row. We can clean this up by tweaking the numbers numerical towards their constraints.\n\nR[abs(R) &lt; 1e-6 ] &lt;- 0\n\n\nrownames(R) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\ncolnames(R) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\n\nround(R, 3)\n\n       A      B      C      D\nA -0.327  0.311  0.002  0.013\nB  0.000 -0.543  0.615 -0.072\nC  0.000  0.000 -0.288  0.288\nD  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000\n\n\nSome numerical error is inevitable in this process and cannot be avoided. However, even cleaning up the small and obvious errors, the transition from B -&gt; D is impossible since it’s negative. Rates are relative to the occupancy of the source state, in this case B. Having a negative rate implies that B would have some transitions in which the dead come alive into B based upon the occupancy of B. Obviously, this is not possible. The problem now is how to adjust the model’s rates to be physically possible, while as faithful to the original data as possible. B is a sicker state, so it should have a higher death rate.\nFirst, let’s double check it recapitulates the original rates.\n\nexpm(R)\n\n4 x 4 Matrix of class \"dgeMatrix\"\n      A     B     C     D\nA 0.721 0.202 0.067 0.010\nB 0.000 0.581 0.407 0.012\nC 0.000 0.000 0.750 0.250\nD 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nWhich exactly matches the original transition probability table given.\nNext, lets’ assume that one has to pass into state C to die and the original data didn’t have frequent enough measurements to detect all the transitions.\n\n# A more plausible death rate for 'A', 'B'\nR['A', 'D'] &lt;- 0\nR['B', 'D'] &lt;- 0\n\ndiag(R) &lt;- diag(R) - rowSums(R) # Keep it Markovian\nround(expm(R), 3)\n\n4 x 4 Matrix of class \"dgeMatrix\"\n      A     B     C     D\nA 0.731 0.197 0.066 0.007\nB 0.000 0.541 0.393 0.066\nC 0.000 0.000 0.750 0.250\nD 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nThe rate from A-&gt;D is within error of the original study. However, deaths from B are at a much higher rate. This is all under the assumption that one must pass through C to die, and the adjusted transitions reflect this.\nNow one could add a competing event to to the model as a rate adding a new row column with it’s defined rates and compute the updated transition probability matrix.\nThese difficulties of working backward from probabilities unscore the importance of having the original estimates be rates that have been adjusted to be the non-competing rate (e.g., based on survival models).\n\n\n\n\nThe above examples also illustrate another difficulty: correctly summarizing costs and utilities in the presence of implied “jumpover” states. For example, we zeroed the rate of A-&gt;D, yet the final transition matrix contains that transition.\nAssume that the transition B-&gt;C entailed a cost, given that some of the population goes A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D these transitions are hidden in the embedded transition matrix, yet a summary of the number of B-&gt;C transitions is needed for a time step. One can solve this by adding non-Markovian states or accumulator states to track these transitions.\nThe diagonal term of the transition intensity matrix is the negative sum of all Markovian states. Additional rows and columns can be added that violate the principal that total state occupancy cannot be created or destroyed, by simply leaving them out of the balancing term of the diagonal.\n\nRwAcc &lt;- cbind(rbind(R, rep(0, 4)), rep(0, 5))\nrownames(RwAcc) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"AccBC\")\ncolnames(RwAcc) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"AccBC\")\n\nRwAcc['B', 'AccBC'] &lt;- RwAcc['B', 'C']\nround(expm(RwAcc), 3)\n\n5 x 5 Matrix of class \"dgeMatrix\"\n          A     B     C     D AccBC\nA     0.731 0.197 0.066 0.007 0.071\nB     0.000 0.541 0.393 0.066 0.459\nC     0.000 0.000 0.750 0.250 0.000\nD     0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000 0.000\nAccBC 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nNote that once embedded into probabilities, there is a transition from A-&gt;AccBC which tracks how many transitions from A-&gt;B-&gt;C and B-&gt;C occur. The original rate specified was zero for A-&gt;AccBC, but due to jumping states this now has a non-zero probability and the accumulator is able to track this.\nIdealy the original rate estimates would have assumed a structural model that was sensible and rates could be estimated to match the data. This is a statistical modeling problem outside the scope of this appendix.\nFor the sake of organization, it is recommended that the upper left matrix remain the original Markov and all the non-Markovian rows be to the bottom and right of the matrix.\n\n\n\nAnother problem that occurs is that of non-stationary rates. What if a rate is changing over an interval time step? How is this best modeled? A first order approach would be to simply take the mean of the rates at either time point. A higher order approach is to integrate the total risk exposure over the time interval.\n\\[r_{e} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} r(t) dt\\] This computes the effective rate \\(r_e\\) from a time varying rate, \\(r(t)\\).\nFor example, in our applications the probability of death from outside causes could be modeled based on mortality tables using a Gompertz distribution with a shape \\(a\\) and rate \\(b\\) parameter. The hazard function of a distribution is the continuous rate function. The hazard function can be derived from the probability density function (PDF) divided by 1 minus cumulative probability function (CDF). For the Gompertz this is,\n\\[h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = \\frac{b e^{at} e^{-b/a(e^{at}-1)}}{e^{-b/a (e^{at}-1)}} = b e^{at}\\]\nFrom this the effective rate over a timestep of a discrete Markov simulation can be computed.\n\\[r_{e} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} b e^{at} dt = \\frac{b}{a} (e^{at_2} - e^{at_1})\\]\nWhile this exists as an anayltical result, in general it’s better to use the effective risk over a time interval as this leads to improved accuracy of a simulation."

    "text": "The above examples also illustrate another difficulty: correctly summarizing costs and utilities in the presence of implied “jumpover” states. For example, we zeroed the rate of A-&gt;D, yet the final transition matrix contains that transition.\nAssume that the transition B-&gt;C entailed a cost, given that some of the population goes A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D these transitions are hidden in the embedded transition matrix, yet a summary of the number of B-&gt;C transitions is needed for a time step. One can solve this by adding non-Markovian states or accumulator states to track these transitions.\nThe diagonal term of the transition intensity matrix is the negative sum of all Markovian states. Additional rows and columns can be added that violate the principal that total state occupancy cannot be created or destroyed, by simply leaving them out of the balancing term of the diagonal.\n\nRwAcc &lt;- cbind(rbind(R, rep(0, 4)), rep(0, 5))\nrownames(RwAcc) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"AccBC\")\ncolnames(RwAcc) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"AccBC\")\n\nRwAcc['B', 'AccBC'] &lt;- RwAcc['B', 'C']\nround(expm(RwAcc), 3)\n\n5 x 5 Matrix of class \"dgeMatrix\"\n          A     B     C     D AccBC\nA     0.731 0.197 0.066 0.007 0.071\nB     0.000 0.541 0.393 0.066 0.459\nC     0.000 0.000 0.750 0.250 0.000\nD     0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000 0.000\nAccBC 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000\n\n\nNote that once embedded into probabilities, there is a transition from A-&gt;AccBC which tracks how many transitions from A-&gt;B-&gt;C and B-&gt;C occur. The original rate specified was zero for A-&gt;AccBC, but due to jumping states this now has a non-zero probability and the accumulator is able to track this.\nIdealy the original rate estimates would have assumed a structural model that was sensible and rates could be estimated to match the data. This is a statistical modeling problem outside the scope of this appendix.\nFor the sake of organization, it is recommended that the upper left matrix remain the original Markov and all the non-Markovian rows be to the bottom and right of the matrix."

    "text": "Another problem that occurs is that of non-stationary rates. What if a rate is changing over an interval time step? How is this best modeled? A first order approach would be to simply take the mean of the rates at either time point. A higher order approach is to integrate the total risk exposure over the time interval.\n\\[r_{e} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} r(t) dt\\] This computes the effective rate \\(r_e\\) from a time varying rate, \\(r(t)\\).\nFor example, in our applications the probability of death from outside causes could be modeled based on mortality tables using a Gompertz distribution with a shape \\(a\\) and rate \\(b\\) parameter. The hazard function of a distribution is the continuous rate function. The hazard function can be derived from the probability density function (PDF) divided by 1 minus cumulative probability function (CDF). For the Gompertz this is,\n\\[h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = \\frac{b e^{at} e^{-b/a(e^{at}-1)}}{e^{-b/a (e^{at}-1)}} = b e^{at}\\]\nFrom this the effective rate over a timestep of a discrete Markov simulation can be computed.\n\\[r_{e} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} b e^{at} dt = \\frac{b}{a} (e^{at_2} - e^{at_1})\\]\nWhile this exists as an anayltical result, in general it’s better to use the effective risk over a time interval as this leads to improved accuracy of a simulation."
