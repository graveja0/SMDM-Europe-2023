## Welcome to Berlin!

## Learning Objectives

-   Underlying robust property of decision modeling.
-   Understand options for modeling background mortality based on life tables and parametric mortality models.
-   Construct a cause-deleted life table to model cause-specific and non-cause-specific death.

## The Big Picture

-   Decision thresholds methods, e.g. ICER, NMB, NHB all involve comparing a model run versus a reference run of the same model.
-   For example, a model of $f_{cost}$ and $f_{qaly}$ are run versus $\theta_{ref}$ and $\theta_{target}$.
-   These runs will have error due to misspecification, and in differencing the error can mostly cancel. Let $g$ represent the truth, thus $f(\theta) = g(\theta)+\epsilon_{\theta}$.

## The Hopeful Big Picture

$$\text{ICER} = \frac{f_{cost}(\theta_{target}) - \epsilon_{ct} - f_{cost}(\theta_{ref}) + \epsilon_{cr}}{f_{qaly}(\theta_{target}) - \epsilon_{qt} - f_{qaly}(\theta_{ref}) + \epsilon_{qr}}$$

-   If $\epsilon_{ct} \sim \epsilon_{cr}$ and $\epsilon_{qt} \sim \epsilon_{qr}$ then the model errors cancel and this approaches the true model.
-   The decision threshold is *robust* in this case even when model run results are biased!
-   We will explore this periodically today.
