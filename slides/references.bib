  abstract = {This tutorial presents practical guidance on transforming various typesof information published in journals, or available online from government and other sources, into transition probabilities for use in state-transition models, including cost-effectiveness models. Much, but not all, of the guidance has been previously published in peer-reviewed journals. Our purpose is to collect it in one location to serve as a stand-alone resource for decision modelers who draw most or all of their information from the published literature. Our focus is on the technical aspects of manipulating data to derive transition probabilities. We explain how to derive model transition probabilities from the following types of statistics: relative risks, odds, odds ratios, and rates. We then review the well-known approach for converting probabilities to match the model's cycle length when there are two health-state transitions and how to handle the case of three or more health-state transitions, for which the two-state approach is not appropriate. Other topics discussed include transition probabilities for population subgroups, issues to keep in mind when using data from different sources in the derivation process, and sensitivity analyses, including the use of sensitivity analysis to allocate analyst effort in refining transition probabilities and ways to handle sources of uncertainty that are not routinely formalized in models. The paper concludes with recommendations to help modelers make the best use of the published literature.},

  abstract = {A model?s purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value-of-information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, both in terms of deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

  abstract = {Logistic regression is used frequently in cohort studies and clinical trials. When the incidence of an outcome of interest is common in the study population (\&gt;10\%), the adjusted odds ratio derived from the logistic regression can no longer approximate the risk ratio. The more frequent the outcome, the more the odds ratio overestimates the risk ratio when it is more than 1 or underestimates it when it is less than 1. We propose a simple method to approximate a risk ratio from the adjusted odds ratio and derive an estimate of an association or treatment effect that better represents the true relative risk.},
